### Understanding Wireframing of Pages

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process of a website or application. It allows you to outline the structure and functionality of your web pages before diving into the visual design and development. Here’s a guide to understanding the wireframing of the specified pages and creating a `README.md` for your project:

#### Home Page
- **Header**: Typically includes the logo, navigation menu, and possibly a call-to-action (CTA) button.
- **Main Banner**: A prominent area that often contains a key message, an image, or a slideshow.
- **Sections**: Break down the content into sections like features, services, testimonials, etc.
- **Footer**: Includes links to important pages, contact information, and social media icons.

#### Search Bar
- **Placement**: Usually found in the header for easy access.
- **Design**: A simple input field with a placeholder text and a search button.
- **Functionality**: Users should be able to type in queries and initiate a search by pressing 'Enter' or clicking the search button.

#### Detail Page
- **Header**: Consistent with the home page for easy navigation.
- **Content Area**: Detailed information about a specific item, such as a product, article, or service.
  - **Title**: Clear and descriptive title.
  - **Images/Videos**: Visual content to support the text.
  - **Description**: Detailed text explaining the item.
  - **CTA Buttons**: Options to interact, like 'Buy Now', 'Contact Us', etc.
- **Sidebar**: Optional, can include related links, additional information, or advertisements.
- **Footer**: Consistent with the rest of the site.

#### Footer of Webpage
- **Links**: Important links to pages like About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy, etc.
- **Contact Information**: Email, phone number, and address.
- **Social Media Icons**: Links to social media profiles.
- **Newsletter Signup**: Option to subscribe to a newsletter.
